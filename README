mg(openbsd version) for basic editing
mksh for shell

My mkshrc is included here with enabled history, and some minor vars. Everything else is stock from MirBSD.
TERM is vt220 for compatibility and portability, no syntax coloring or any colors in terminal.

INSTALLATION:
Run install.sh as root, it should work on any sane unix system.
